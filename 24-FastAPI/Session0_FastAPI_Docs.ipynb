    "\n",
    "**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is a **design style** for APIs. \n",
    "REST is a **set of rules** for how APIs should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- You go to a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are clear rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Books are arranged by category\n",
    "- You ask for a book\n",
    "- You return a book\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t change the library’s system yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is like library rules for APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST answers questions like:\n",
    "- How should URLs look?\n",
    "- Which HTTP method should be used?\n",
    "- How should errors be returned?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why REST exists\n",
    "- Standard rules → easier to understand APIs --> <u>Without it</u> - Every app would work differently\n",
    "- Predictable behavior for frontend and backend teams --> <u>Without it</u> -  Developers would get confused\n",
    "- Scales well for large systems --> <u>Without it</u> -  Systems wouldn’t scale\n",
    "\n",
    "REST makes APIs **easy to understand**, even if you’ve never seen them before.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST basics\n",
    "- Everything is a **resource** (users, orders, products)\n",
    "- Resources are identified by **URLs**\n",
    "- Use **HTTP methods** to act on resources\n",
    "- Server does NOT remember client state (stateless)\n"
